# FitFlex (Frontend Only)

FitFlex

Starter project structure for FitFlex (React + Tailwind CSS starter).

This repository contains a minimal folder layout and stub components/pages to get started.

Branding & assets
- Main logo is in `public/logo.svg` (SVG gradient). Replace with your preferred PNG/SVG if you have a higher-resolution image.
- Facility/background image used in the dashboard is `public/facility1.svg`. Replace with photos at the same path (e.g. `public/facility1.jpg`) to display real facility images.

BMI Calculator
- A BMI calculator component has been added at `src/components/BmiCalculator.js` and is reachable at `/bmi`.

Running the project
1. Install dependencies:

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

Notes
- If PowerShell blocks `npm` due to execution policy, run the commands in cmd.exe or run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` in an elevated PowerShell.
- Replace the placeholder images in `public/` with your real photos to get full visual effect.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
